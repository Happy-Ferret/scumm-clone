{"name":"Scumm-clone","tagline":"SCUMM/Adventure game engine in JS","body":"##WIP Scumm/Adventure game engine in JS\r\n\r\nI'm trying to somewhat recreate an engine like ScummVM that allows developers to easily create point and click adventure games.\r\n\r\nMy main priority is to seperate the main engine code, and the actual game/asset code. Everything in the gamesrc folder is configured via JSON objects.\r\n\r\n###Folders\r\n\r\n- enginesrc = main code\r\n- gamesrc = reproducable game maker stuff\r\n- public = compiled/minified version of enginesrc+gamesrc\r\n\r\n###Terminology\r\n\r\n######Layer\r\n\r\nA layer is what your sprites and assets live on. Each sprite, background, and transporter has it's own layer. You can specify the ordering of each layer on the scene.\r\n\r\n######Scene\r\n\r\nA scene is a piece of your world, sort of like a container. It houses all the actors for that scene, transporters to transfer the player to other scenes, and all the background/layer image assets. \r\n\r\nIt also has the ability to have a perspective point, so actors will get smaller as the move closer to the point on a fake z-axis.\r\n\r\n######Actor\r\n\r\nAn actor is a character on the scene, including the main player. Actors can move freely on the scene background. Only player actors can use transporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n######Transporter\r\n\r\nA transporter is a link between scenes. Clicking on a transporter will move the player towards it, then change scene. You can also specify a name for your transporter so the mouseover text will read something like \"Walk to SCUMM Bar\"\r\n\r\n######World\r\n\r\nA world is where all your scenes live. \r\n\r\n\r\n###TODO\r\n\r\nSee TODO.md","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
